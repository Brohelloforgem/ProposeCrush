# ProposeCrush

The Crush Proposal Website is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to propose to their crush. The website features two options, "yes" and "no," but with a twist - when the crush hovers over the "no" option, it automatically turns into "yes." Clicking the "yes" button sends a message directly to WhatsApp saying "I Love You Too."
